  // or 'error' in production, a child logger that inherits the parent's level
  // would silently suppress 'info' audit events — causing the entire audit
  // trail to go dark without any indication that events were dropped.
  //
  // Fix: explicitly set the child logger's level to 'info' before emitting.
  // In pino, each logger instance owns its own level independently of its
  // parent; overriding it on the child ensures audit events are always emitted
  // regardless of the application-wide log level configured at startup.
